A README can often be a potential contributor's first impression of your project. It communicates the project's vision, how to contribute to the project and places where people can donate and installation instructions.

<!--endintro-->

Having a README template ensures that youâ€™re checking all of the boxes for ensuring that contributors have an easy time getting your project up and running and beneficiaries know how to use your code.

README templates can be beneficial for ensuring your personal projects have the features necessary for gaining momentum and ensuring that projects done at an organizational level are up to a high standard.

This README is very basic, the setup instructions are limited and there is room for improvement:

- Bullet points could help better communicate selling points
- Diagrams
- Photos and marketing material
- Multiple level headings
- Known Issues

It's important to keep your README templates in a convenient place to ensure that you can quickly bootstrap a project when you get started.

## What does an awesome README template look like?

An ideal README should foster contributions for a project organically. It provides all of the relevant infomration a technical user would require to get the project up and
running, contribute it, and deploy changes to production if necessary. Simultaneously it should contain a number of clearly documented social media links so that non technical
users can keep an ear to the ground. People who follow the project's social media and see regular updates are more likely to feel actively involved, and thus interested in the
project's succes.

We've created a README template with placeholders where you can add all of the relevant information for your project to ensure that it's a success. Bare in mind that not all of
the information listed will be relevant to your particular project. For instance, closed source projects more than likely won't contain social media or sponsorship links. Feel free to remove any placeholders that aren't relevant to your project.
