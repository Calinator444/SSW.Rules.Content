When building an AI-powered solution, developers have access to a wide variety of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama, GPT-4o, and Mistral. However, testing these models can be costly, especially when integrating them into an application.

<!--endintro-->

## The challenge of trying out AI models

Many AI providers charge per API call, making it expensive to experiment with different models. For example:

- **Decisision fatigue** There's  a large number of Language models to choose from. The market size is expected to reach 13.52 billion in 2029.
- **Testing Integrations** AI services generally provide their own API's with separate documentation for use.
- **Cost accumulates rapidly** when testing AI integration, particularly with large prompts or frequent calls.

## The GitHub Models advantage

[GitHub Models](https://github.com) provides an ecosystem where developers can try out a wide variety of LLMs in one place, including (but not limited to):

- Open AI GPT-4o
- OpenAI GPT-4o mini
- Phi-3
- Phi-3.5
- Phi-4
- AI21 Jamba
- Codestral
- Cohere Command R
- DeepSeek-R1
- Llama-3
- Meta-llama-3
- Ministral
- Mistral

This makes it easier to compare models based on performance, cost, and suitability for your project.

### Low Development Overhead
- GitHub models supports a large amount of language models within the same ecosystem. The development cost of switching from one model to another is minimal. Switching from one model to another is as simple as changing an API parameter. Your code implementation can stay the same.
- While Other solutions like Google's APIs provide code samples to get you started, the library for using the API is different than other services like 

## Deploying to production

Once you've identified the best model for your needs, GitHub Models simplifies deployment. You can:

1. Generate a **production key** for your app.
2. Start incurring costs **only when you go live**.

This approach allows you to make an informed decision before committing financially, ensuring you're using the right AI model for your application.

## Conclusion

Before selecting an AI model, **test multiple options to evaluate quality, cost, and ease of integration**. Using platforms like GitHub Models can help you explore different LLMs efficiently while keeping experimentation costs under control.
